# RateMySkwela

Simple review app created with the MERN stack.

This project is a fun venture by a group of developers aiming to explore the MERN stack. We're diving into displaying data with REST API, securing it with Google OAuth, and managing state using Redux.

## Introduction

This project is still under development and I pray to God it actually gets finished. :)

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Redux, TailwindCSS, Firebase, Vite, Flowbite

**Server:** Node, Express

**Database:** MongoDB

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jacocanete/ratemyskwela.git
```

Install server dependencies in root folder

```bash
  npm install
```

Run server

```bash
  npm run dev
```

Go to client directory

```bash
  cd client
```

Install client dependencies

```bash
  npm i
```

Run client

```bash
  npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your root folder's .env file

MONGO = `CONNECTION STRING`

JWT_SECRET = `CUSTOM SECRET KEY`

And another .env file inside the client folder. This is for the OAuth.

VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY = `FIREBASE_API_KEY`

## Optimizations

I'm still fairly new so my code will probably look horrible as I'm really just diving into this blindly. I have knowledge of the fundamentals but the React framework is new to me and I've only been learning parts from the Tech Stack that I actually need for the project, so basically nothing comprehensive yet.
